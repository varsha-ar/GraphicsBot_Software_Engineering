| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESENTATION** | 18.8/25 | Visualizing github activity -- but the presentations would have been stronger if it had spent more time communication why this problem is important. |
| **PEER PRESENTATION EVALUATIONS** | 10.0/10 | (If you did 4 or more, your bonus will be on your individual moodle grade.) |
| **REPORT** | 15.0/15 | Report has some details that would have been great in the video. |
| **360 PEER EVALUATION** | 50.0/50 | (If your moodle score is significantly lower than your team score, you might not have submitted a 360 peer evaluation.) |
