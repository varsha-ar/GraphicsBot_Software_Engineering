| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 15.0/15 | Problem is explained well.  |
| **Bot Description** | 10.0/10 | Good description. Gives a nice solution to the problem stated. |
| **Use Cases** | 10.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:  UC1 "The use case ends when the customer is satisfied" -- This is not part of this phase -- that's acceptance testing.  "they see for a particular analysis"  <-- What analysis?  For a use case, you need to provide specifics, and details of how the interactions work.  Bot says "X" User provides data "Y" (date ranges? repo names? users?)   <br>S2 Github Dashboard is not listed in the main flow.  [S3] The user has four tabs to choose from.    -- This is way to broad for a subflow.  Break this into smaller pieces -- maybe different UCs?<br><br>UC2 -- "Viewing the custom visuals prepared by the user." is in the title but the main flow doesn't say anything about this.  The main flow should do what in the title.<br><br>"The user will now be directed" <-- how are they directed?   A flashing blink tag?  Does the computer 3-D print an arrow?   You need details.<br><br>All UCs should be re-written with nearly everything in the main flow -- the subflows are about data -- re-read the sample given in the instructions |
| **Wireframes** | 10.0/15 | the wireframe does not show what data goes where.  |
| **Storyboard** | 10.0/15 | Doesn't really tell a story.  |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 25.0/30 | The architecture components are not mentioned. On client side, instead of mentioning the tools/frameworks being used, architecture should contain the components that would be made out of these components.   There should also be connections between client and server side, no? |
