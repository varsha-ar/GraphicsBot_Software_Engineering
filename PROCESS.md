# Milestone: PROCESS

# Sprint 1: Mon Mar 21 -- Fri Mar 25
## Process
We aim to complete the functionality for The visualization BOT - Janet by the end of sprint 2.
For sprint 1 we have decided to work on two user stories, they are: 
1. **Setup the blob storage backend** with story points : 5.
2. **Setup GitHub authentication** with story points : 3.

This is a screenshot of how the user story looks with the story points (visible as labels), Assigned by and Assignees:

## Practices

<u>Core Practice:</u>

We have decided to integrate Pair Programming practice with our current development. For sprint 1, the pairs that are working together are:

Neil and Varsha (Driver: Varsha, Navigator: Neil)

Nishitha and Anisha (Driver: Nishitha, Navigator: Anisha)

We plan to interchange the roles of the Driver and the Navigator in Sprint 2.

<u>Collary Practices:</u>

1. **Incremental Development** - Depending on the user story that is being worked on each pair of developers are developing and deploying only one main functionality on the landing page. For example: Developers are working on the functionality of a single tab and deploying the changes before moving onto the next tab. The tabs for viewing the visualizations offered by the BOT look like this:

This method is being followed to reduce risks and the margin for merge conflict errors. We have adopted this practice as we have faced merge conflict errors in the past.

2. **Shared Code**- To improve efficiency, we are allowing any developer to pull the most recent changes and change code whenever needed. Once changes have been made, their pull request will be reviewed by the other members of the team and merged accordingly.

We have maintained this iteration worksheet for both sprints

## Status of Kanban Project Board

* <u>Completed Tasks:</u> 

    As of the end of Sprint 1, we have completed setting up GitHub authentication for the user and we have set up the backend blob storage environment. We have also added the functionality of uploading user data, visuals and snapshots as blobs to our backend storage. 

* <u>Incomplete Tasks:</u>

    We are yet to finish building test cases for the blob storage and plan to push this task for the next sprint.
    
* <u> Future Tasks:</u>
    
    For the next sprint, we plan to complete the other  user stories- Implement and load custom visuals, implement the functionality for saving and retrieving the custom visuals and snapshots to and from the blob storage. 

# Sprint 2 : Sat Mar 26 -- Fri Apr 1
## Process
Continuing our dev work on the Graphics BOT we have decided to work on these user stories this sprint: 
1. **Get data for visuals** with story points : 3.
2. **Save and retrieve snapshots** with story points : 5.
3. **Implement and load custom visuals** with story points :8.

This is a screenshot of how the user story looks with the Assigned by and Assignees:

## Practices

<u>Core Practice:</u>

We have decided to integrate Pair Programming practice for this sprint as well. 

We have interchanged the roles of the Driver and the Navigator in Sprint 2 as compared to Sprint 1.

<u>Collary Practices:</u>

We have followed the same Incremental Development practice as Sprint 1. We have also continued to implement shared Code practices. Any changes made by developers are first addressed by reviewing pull requests, once that is sorted the developer's branch is merged with the dev branch.


## Iteration Worksheet

Updates for Sprint 2 have been logged in worksheet.md,  file here -> [WORKSHEET.md](/WORKSHEET.md)

We have maintained this iteration worksheet for both sprints

## Status of Kanban Project Board

* <u>Completed Tasks:</u> 

    We have completed setting up the functionality for saving and retrieving snapshot data as well as getting data for visuals. 

    * We have implemented custom visuals as a part of this sprint as well.

    * We have made a minor change to the result tab 4 is going to display. The user card used to look like this:

    ![image](assets/oldtab4.JPG)

    * Now the user card looks like this:

    ![cutebot](assets/newtab4.jpeg)

* <u> Incomplete Tasks:</u>

    We have to work on loading custom visuals which is a part of the user story : Implement and Load Custom Visuals. We also have to set up test cases for blob storage.

### <u>Reports</u>
Discussed the status of progress with current sprint:

â€¢	Work on and finish the user stories pending for sprint 2.

### <u>Action Items:</u>
1. Finished the user story for :Get data for visuals.
2. Started work on implementing Custom visual data.
3. Improved visuals for user cards under tab 4.
4. Showcased out BOT for TA demo.
