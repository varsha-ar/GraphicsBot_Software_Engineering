## What Problem does Janet Solve?

Any software engineering task requires decisions to be made about setting goals, allocating tasks, prioritizing and deprioritizing work items. These tasks have to be managed ensuring that deadlines are met and company standards are met. Every successful manager identifies choke points in the development process and implements ways to optimize. These choke points can include inefficient team management, piling technical debt, inaccurate requirement understanding, etc. Identifying a choke point is the first step to optimization. However, most project management tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub offer limited aggregated metrics.
 
Our Bot - JANET can display metrics such as bugs per milestone, issues allocated to each contributor in a project, number of commits made by contributors and also offers a customization panel that allows users to create their own visuals, all on a single interactive dashboard. We believe that using the data displayed on the board, any manager will be empowered to make better decisions for project management.

## Primary features and screenshots of the Janet Bot

In order to use our bot one has to visit : [Link](https://janetprod.azurewebsites.net)

The user can click on any one of the following four tabs for viewing the graphs that have been generated by our bot.

Tab 2 : <u>Project Bugs</u>

On clicking this tab the user is able to see a horizontal clustered bar graph. The graph has information of the status of bugs in a current project based on the milestone. Each milestone has 3 bar graphs, first one indicating the number of open bugs, second indicating the number of closed bugs and last one for keeping a count of the total number of bugs. There is also a legend included which helps the user to distinguish between the bars. As an additional feature we can also make the graph informative by displaying the exact count of bugs on a certain bar when a user hovers over it.

On clicking this tab the user is able to see a stacked column bar graph indicating the various tasks in a particular milestone. The various stacks are created based on the type of task that is allocated to a milestone; this could be tasks with different labels like enhancement, won't fix , documentation, etc. There is a legend on top of the graph giving more information about each stack. As an additional feature we have also made the graph informative by displaying the exact count of tasks on a certain bar when a user hovers over it.

### **2. Custom Visuals**

The left-hand panel of the Janet Bot website is called "Customization". This panel has features that allow users to create their visuals.
Users can follow these steps to generate custom visuals: 
Select type of graph from visualization dropdown such as pie and bar 
Select type of metric from the Dimensions dropdown such as no of issues or pull requests 
 
* If the user chooses no of Issues for the dimension then under the Measures dropdown the user can choose between :
- Issues per Milestone
- Issues per Label
- Issues per Status
 
* If the user had selected Pull Requests under dimensions then under the Measures drop down the user can choose between :
- Pull Requests per User
- Pull Requests per Milestone.
 
Once the user is happy with their selection they click on the "Generate Custom Visual" button. This will generate the desired visual and display it in the visual area.

Another feature that is available in the customization panel is the "Save Custom Visual" button. If the user wishes to save the graph that they created they can do so by clicking on this button. These visuals are stored with a timestamp as their name.

We have linked our Bot to communicate with our cloud database - Azure Blob Storage to save and retrieve any visuals that are saved by the user. Using the "Load Custom Visual" dropdown, the user can access any visual that they have saved. The same technology was used for "snapshot" as well which is discussed in the next point.

### **3. Snapshot**

Just beside the "Select Repository" dropdown is the "Snapshot" button. This button allows a user to take a snapshot of any visual that is present in the visual area. By clicking on the snapshot button the visual gets stored in the database. These snapshots can be accessed anytime by clicking on the "Load Snapshots" dropdown in the customization panel. Snapshots are stored with a timestamp as their name.The snapshot chosen will load in the visual area.

The idea behind including this feature was to enable a user to measure the progress/ activity over a period of time. This allows users to understand changes visually - making it easier to track progress/activities.
